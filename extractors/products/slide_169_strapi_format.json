    "description": "## STERILIZATION METHODS\n- ETO (Ethylene Oxide Sterilization): Uses ethylene oxide gas to penetrate medical devices and kill microorganisms at low temperatures. Ideal for heat-sensitive materials like plastics, electronics, and complex devices. Requires aeration time to remove toxic gas residues and is a slow process.\n- R (Gamma Sterilization): Uses high-energy gamma radiation (from Cobalt-60) to break down bacterial DNA and eliminate contaminants. Used for single-use medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and heat-sensitive products. Requires specialized handling and shielding due to radiation exposure.\n- Steam Sterilization (Autoclave): Uses high-pressure steam at 121–134°C (250–273°F) to kill microorganisms through heat and moisture. Suitable for metal instruments, surgical tools, glassware, and textiles. Not suitable for heat-sensitive materials like some plastics and electronics.\n- Beam Sterilization (Electron Beam - E-Beam): Uses high-energy electrons to sterilize by breaking microbial DNA. Often used for pharmaceuticals, syringes, and medical packaging. Faster than gamma radiation, no toxic residues. Limited penetration compared to gamma sterilization.",
